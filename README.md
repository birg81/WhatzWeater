This WebApp is an example tutorial. It exploits the AJAX technology in JavaScript through the use of the fetch function the API of the OpenWeatherMap REST services are called which returns data in JSON format that is printed on the web page. IMPORTANT: you must have your personal secret AppID Key, otherwise the WebApp doesn't work. After registering on the site https://openweathermap.org, you will receive your personal secret key which you will need to paste into the JavaScript code. If your PC is connected to the internet, by typing the name of a location in the search bar, other useful information will be shown in addition to the temperature perceived in that location.
